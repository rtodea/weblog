When trying algorithms for the first time it might
be useful to have a TDD starter kit.

As I am more familiar with JavaScript, a JavaScript TDD
starter kit was developed.

It contains:

1. [MochaJS](mochajs.org)
1. [Chai](chaijs.com)
1. [SinonJS](sinonjs.org)

Available at [https://github.com/rtodea/js-tdd](https://github.com/rtodea/js-tdd).
